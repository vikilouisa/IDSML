    "#THE RELEVANCE OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS IN DATA ANALYSIS\n",
    "#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFWsuO9f74o\n",
    "#A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a population parameter with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "#It is used to estimate the uncertainty around a sample statistic, such as the mean or proportion.\n",
    "#Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%.\n",
    "#A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and calculate the confidence interval for each sample, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.\n",
    "#The width of the confidence interval depends on the sample size, variability in the data, and the chosen confidence level.\n",
    "#Larger sample sizes and lower variability lead to narrower confidence intervals, while higher confidence levels result in wider intervals.\n",
    "#Confidence intervals are useful for making inferences about a population based on a sample and for comparing different groups or treatments in experiments.\n",
